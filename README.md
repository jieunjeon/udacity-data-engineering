This is a project submission repository for Udacity's Data Engineering NanoDegree program

## Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres

### Objective

In this project, I built a model for user activity data for Sparkify, a music streaming software. I built a relational database and an ETL pipeline to optimize queries for determining which songs users are listening to. I also created Fact and Dimension tables in PostgreSQL and inserted data into it.

## Project 2: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

### Objective

In this project, I implemented an Apache Cassandra database and ETL pipeline to optimize searches for determining what music users are listening to. For Apache Cassandra, I model the data such that you can perform certain queries given by Sparkify's analytics team.

## Project3: Cloud Data Warehouses (AWS Redshift & S3)

### Objective
In this project, I created an ELT pipeline that collects data from S3, stages it in Redshift, and transforms it into a series of dimensional tables so that their analytics team may continue to discover insights into what music their customers are listening to.
